                   <h3>There has been a debate for many years if college athletes should be paid or should not be paid. College athletes are more than entitled to be granted a salary from not only the revenue that the college athletes bring in but the sacrifices they make to do it while still having to maintain a decent grade point average for their school work. On the other hand, some complications may be caused by having to pay the athletes.</h3>

                    <h1>How Much Money College Sports Produce</h1>
                    <h3>College sports make money from ticket sales, television deals, and sponsors. College sports make so much money that even spectators watching the games can make money off of the players. Most college games can be betted on and if the bettor chooses the team that wins, how many points the two teams score all together, and how many more points the winning team has over the losing team. In college sports, each division 1 school is put into a conference. Four of the biggest conferences that had multi-billion dollar deals. The Pac 12 Conference has a deal with ESPN and Fox that roughly equals three billion dollars. The Big 12 has a deal with FOX and ESPN/ABC worth two and a half-billion dollars. The ACC has a deal with ESPN/ABC that roughly equals three-point six billion dollars. Lastly, the SEC has a deal with ESPN/ABC for two-point twenty-five billion dollars.</h3>

                    <h1>How Much Money NCAA's Money Makers Make</h1>
                    <h3>With all the money that the athletes bring in only seven percent of the revenue collected by the National Collegiate Athletic Association goes back to the athletes in scholarships and living stipends. If fifty percent of the revenue that colleges in prestigious conferences bring in from football and basketball, the football athletes would each earn around three hundred and sixty thousand dollars and the basketball athletes would receive around five hundred thousand dollars. College athletes sometimes come from poor communities and the money they would receive from the colleges that they play for would be beneficial for the athlete and their family.</h3>

                    <h1>Why College Athletes Should Not Be Paid</h1>
                    <h3>There are a few issues that is stopping the NCAA from paying the athletes. Why College Athletes Should Not Be Paid. Title IX would cause complications because the United States of America would have to change the law or this may cause the colleges to not be able to fund every sport if they had to pay everyone and they might have to drop some of the sports. Also, if college athletes were to get paid it would take the competitiveness out of college athletics. All the five-star athletes would go to whatever college could pay them the most.</h3>
